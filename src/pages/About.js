                    this is the answer to this question. im not too great with words so we need a paragraph
                    explaining the app and how it can help people.
                    we could also show a cool little illustration/ map about what happens e.g "were always watching earthquake data",
                    "when theres an earthquake in your area we add you to a search database that tells us your in danger", "if you tell us
                    you're safe we take you off" etc but each section can be a visualisation. All time dependent though.
